# Policy-based Reinforcement Learning Methods

## Discrete Action Space:

  1. REINFORCE (Discounted Reward)
  
  2. REINFORCE with Baseline (Discounted Reward)
  
  3. Actor-Critic (Discounted Reward)
  
  4. Actor-Critic with Prioritized Experience Replay (Discounted Reward)
  
  5. Actor-Critic with Prioritized Experience Replay (Average Reward)
  

## Continuous Action Space (Discounted Reward):

  1.REINFORCE with linear approximators
  
  2.REINFORCE with nonlinear approximators
  
  3.REINFORCE with nonlinear approximators & baseline
  
  4.Actor-Critic
  
  5.Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
  
  6.Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
